# Python - Test-driven development

* <b>Interactive Test:</b> the 'doctest' module enables python to search for text that resemble interactive Python sessions and execute to see if they work exactly as shown

* <b>Testing is important</b> to ensure the program works as expected. Some mistakes, if they get into production, can be very expensive to recover from

* Doctest example:
```
"""
>>> print("This is a test")
This is a test
"""
```
