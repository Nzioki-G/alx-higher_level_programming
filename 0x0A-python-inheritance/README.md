# Python - Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows creation of a heirarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. <br>

* <b>Super / Base / Parent class:</b> the class inherited <em>from</em>
* <b>Subclass:</b> a class that is derived from another

```super()``` returns the parent class object(s) for the child class to access inherited attributes and functions<br>

* <b>Magic methods:</b> special functionality methods that are surrounded by double underscores
