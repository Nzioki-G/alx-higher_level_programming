# Python - More Classes and Objects
## points learnt:
* use ```cls(variable)``` to instatiate from another method within class
* use self.att to instantiate via setter, self.__attr to bypass setter
* ```cls_name + "(" + str(attr) + ")"``` to get repr pf object
* use ```eval()``` to init from __repr__
* __del__ is called when instance is deleted
* instance.method() is the same as Class_Name.method(instance)
